# Red Line Potential Report
This project aims to evaluate the potential effect that building the Baltimore Red Line could have on the food environment of the city. 
In order to determine which areas are in greatest need of support, maps pertaining to income, transit accessibility, vehicle ownership, as well as grocery store 
locations are plotted and compared.
